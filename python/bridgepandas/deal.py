    Generate *n* random bridge deals, returned as a DataFrame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of deals to generate.
    west, north, east, south : optional
        Constraint on each direction's hand. Accepted types:

        - ``None`` — no constraint
        - ``str`` — partial hand string ``"AK/Q/-/-"`` (S/H/D/C format, known cards)
        - ``Hand`` — fix that seat to an exact hand
        - ``int`` — int64 bitmask of required cards
        - ``HandSet`` — BDD constraint (enables fast BDD sampling)
        -- example: ``(h.HCP >= 15) & (h.HCP <= 17) & (h.MATCH_SHAPE("any 4333 + any 4432 + any 5332")``
        - ``callable`` — ``f(Hand) -> bool`` (forces slow accept/reject path)
        -- example: ``lambda h: h.hcp >= 15 and h.hcp <= 17 and h.shape in [(4,3,3,3),(4,4,3,2),(5,3,3,2)]``

        If none of the four directional constraints are ``callable``, then
        fast sampling is used; however note that sometimes converting
        HandSets into DealSets (which happens internally) can have a one-time
        startup cost of a few seconds.  If any of them are ``callable`` then
        we use a sample/reject strategy, which can become slow if your
        criteria match only rare hands.

    accept : callable, optional
        ``f(Deal) -> bool`` applied to each candidate deal as a post-filter.
    seed : int or numpy.random.Generator, optional
        RNG seed for reproducibility.
    fail_count : int
        A safety valve to protect against impossible constraints;
        after this many consecutive failures before the first success, raise
        ``ValueError``.  ``None`` means no limit.
